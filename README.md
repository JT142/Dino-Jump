## ðŸ•¹ How to play
The user controls the Dinosaur and helps him jump over obstacles by pressing the space bar. If the Dinosaur fails to jump over any obstacles successfully, a "Game Over" sign will pop out. 

The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.

<br>

## ðŸ›  Development 

### General idea:
* Game should start after clicking the 'enter' key
* Obstacles should be dynamic and moving towards the Dinosaur
* Dino should be able to jump
* Scoreboard should increase every time Dino jumps over an object successfully
* When Dino collides with an object, "Game Over" should pop out on the screen 
* Game should restart after closing the pop out

### Approach:
* Create a game border. Make sure game border can be dynamically adjusted 
* Create vectors that represent Dinosaur and obstacles
* Make obstacles move towards Dinosaur 
* Allow Dinosaur to jump. Animate jump
* Create game logic: Scoring and losing system 
* Add game visuals: Styling for fonts, add sprites, animations and sound effects


## ðŸŽˆ Future Improvements
<ol>
    <li> Create different difficulty levels, where the speed of the obstacles would be increased </li>
    <li> To add more visual effects to the game </li>
    <li> To create a highscore page </li>
</ol>
