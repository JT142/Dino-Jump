# Dino Jump

## Technologies & Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript & JQuery
- Git & GitHub

## Description

## How to play
The user controls the Dinosaur and helps him jump over obstacles by pressing the space bar. If the Dinosaur fails to jump over any obstacles successfully, a "Game Over" sign will pop out. 

The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.


## Development 

### General idea:
* I want to be able to start the game after clicking the 'enter' key
* I want the obstacles to be dynamic and moving towards the Dinosaur
* I want to see the scoreboard increase every time Dino jumps over an object successfully
* When Dino collides with an object, I want to see "Game Over" pop out on the screen 
* I want to be able to restart the game after closing the pop out

### Approach:
* Create a game border 
* Make sure game border can be dynamically adjusted 
* Create vectors that represent Dinosaur and obstacles
* Make obstacles move towards Dinosaur 
* Allow Dinosaur to jump
* Create game logic: Scoring and losing system 
* Add game visuals: Styling for fonts, add sprites, animations and sound effects


## Improvements
<ol>
    <li> Create different difficulty levels, where the speed of the obstacles would be increased </li>
    <li> To add more visual effects to the game </li>
    <li> To create a highscore page </li>
</ol>
